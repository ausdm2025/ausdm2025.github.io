#### Abstract:

Being a faculty member is one of the most important aims for researchers. This is not an easy task, especially for researchers who just graduated from universities. The main difficulties include 1) time management among supervision, securing research funds, teaching, and publications; 2) mindset change from students to faculties; 3) general work-life balance. In this talk, I will list some points regarding the above difficulties based on my experience and hope it will be useful for more junior researchers.Â

#### Abstract:

In this talk, I will delve into the multifaceted journey of women in computer science, with a particular focus on the current situation of female academics in Australia. Despite the significant strides made in gender equality, women continue to face unique challenges in the academic sphere. Drawing from recent data and studies, I will provide an overview of the representation, achievements, and hurdles encountered by female academics in Australia today. Building on this context, I will share my personal experiences and strategies that have enabled me to overcome the obstacles faced by women in this field. From navigating gender biases to balancing professional and personal responsibilities, I will discuss practical approaches that have proven effective in my career. Finally, I will offer actionable suggestions and considerations for female academics in computer science. These insights aim to empower women to thrive in their careers, foster supportive networks, and advocate for systemic changes within their institutions. Join me as we explore the current landscape, share personal narratives, and envision a more inclusive future for women in computer science.

#### Abstract:

My journey into the realm of data has been driven by an intrinsic curiosity and a deep-seated passion for understanding complex information. The transition from academia to the professional sphere marked the beginning of a series of enriching experiences and challenges that have significantly shaped my career. This transition not only honed my problem-solving abilities but also underscored the importance of resilience and ongoing learning. Working in the industry has afforded me invaluable opportunities to tackle real-world challenges, bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application. These experiences have profoundly enhanced my problem-solving skills and allowed me to address issues that often serve as catalysts for research and innovation. Unlike the more static nature of academia, the dynamic environment of the industry encourages a balance between in-depth research and broader exploration, offering a more immediate impact on societal needs. As a woman navigating a predominantly male-dominated field, I have observed firsthand how diversity can act as a powerful driver of innovation. Women in technology bring unique perspectives that not only contribute to more inclusive and effective solutions but also lead transformative initiatives with far-reaching benefits for society. This diversity of thought is essential for fostering creativity and advancing technological progress.
