# Sponsorship
> On behalf of the Conference Organising Committee, it is our great pleasure to welcome you to Australasian Data Science and Machine Learning Conference 2023, held in Auckland, New Zealand, in December 2023.

Since 2002, the Australasian Data Science and Machine Learning Conference (AusDM) has been the premier conference in the region for researchers and practitioners working in data and its analysis. Over 3 days and dozens of varied sessions, AusDM 2023 will bring delegates together at The University of Auckland in beautiful New Zealand to share and discover breakthroughs and establish connections.

In its 21st year, AusDM has rebranded to better reflect its focus on modern techniques and approaches in large and complex data analysis, but its purpose is unchanged: to progress knowledge for the betterment of everyday life for all humans. Fittingly, with the increasing demand for data-driven knowledge and technology to be embedded both at home and work, the theme of this year’s conference is Data Science and Machine Learning: Now part of everyone everyday.  Crossing art and science, AusDM 2023 will immerse a diverse group of delegates in cutting-edge research, real-world applications, and stimulating discussions, in addition to tutorials on established fundamentals.

AusDM believes that a key input into the evolution of data science and analytics is diversity, and therefore AusDM should be widespread in both its benefits and reach – early career vs experienced, local vs overseas, small vs large applications. AusDM is a not-for-profit* conference that provides academics and industry practitioners access to a powerful repository of knowledge over 3 interactive days – without breaking the bank.

Registration fees fund typical conference costs such as room bookings, food and drinks for scheduled sessions, printing, and equipment hire. To create a more inclusive conference experience, we are seeking sponsors to support AusDM. Your sponsorships will go towards funding 3 main areas:

- Early career grants: Awarded to paper authors at the beginning of their promising careers in data science and machine learning
- Travel expenses for keynote speakers: As an Australasian conference, we are keen to involve speakers from the whole region
- Special sessions: With additional funds, we will be able to put on special sessions not already scheduled to go in-depth into topics of interest e.g., Ethics in AI

We hope that you will consider one the following sponsorship packages. For more information or to discuss your
options, please contact the AusDM 2023 Sponsorship Chair, Annelies Tjetjep. The full sponsorship information can be accessed in PDF format here.
