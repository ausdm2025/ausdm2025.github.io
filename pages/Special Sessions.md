# Special Sessions
To celebrate the first time of AusDM in New Zealand, this year we have lined-up a set of special topics to facilitate sharing and learning of the latest research advances in data science and machine learning areas of high relevance for todayâ€™s society. These sessions are chaired by recognised experts in the field. We strongly encourage submissions in these areas (please see research-track submission guidelines here):

Williamson, Generative AI Lead, Deloitte New Zealand / Senior Lecturer, University of Waikato):** Societal implications of data science and machine learning, fairness, interpretability, transparency, trustworthiness, human-in-the-loop machine learning, climate change and sustainability.
- **Generative modelling (Chair: Dr Jiamou Liu, Senior Lecturer, The University of Auckland):** including multimodal ML, ML for coding, ML for drug discovery / molecular tasks, and generative models in general.
- **Interdisciplinary applications of ML/data science (Chair: Dr Mingming Gong, Senior Lecturer, The University of Melbourne):** applications in social sciences, urban planning, medicine, humanities, social good, etc.
