#### Abstract:
Computational and statistical analytic methods alone may not solve the big data problems effectively, and their results could be rejected by users due to the lack of trust and interpretability. Interactive visualisation can explain, verify, and allow users to explore and see computed and original data in interpretable ways informing pattern recognition, insight, and relationship discovery. With so much information at your fingertips, it is a challenge to visualise complex and multidimensional data, highlight important messages, and remove the clutters that may cost audience an extra cognitive load. 

This tutorial serves as a practical guide that provides theoretical knowledge and visualisation in exploratory and explanatory data analysis. The tutorial includes hands-on activities and practical demonstrations on how computational analytics can connect with visualisation on Tableau and Python platforms. Finally, we will showcase an interactive method to visualise complex charts, and flow charts on maps using the above platforms. 

The topics of this two-hour tutorial are

- Theoretical and knowledge
  + Multi-dimensional data visualisation
  + Visualisation for explanatory data analysis
  + Geographics Data Visualisation
  + Hands-on activities
 
- Computational analytics and visualisation with Python and Tableau
  + Real-time interactive visualisation with computational results
  + Visualising complex charts and flow charts on maps
  + Hands-on activities
