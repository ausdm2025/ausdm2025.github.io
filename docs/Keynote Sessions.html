                        <p>This tutorial on Human-Centred Explainable AI (HCXAI) aims to equip participants with the
                            knowledge and skills necessary to develop explainable AI systems. Through a human-centred
                            approach, participants will explore core principles such as user understanding, trust
                            calibration, and cognitive engagement. The session will cover a variety of explanation
                            methods, offering guidance on designing effective explanations that enhance user
                            understanding and interaction with AI systems. Attendees will gain insights into best
                            practices for conducting user studies and evaluating XAI systems. Through interactive
                            demonstrations and hands-on activities, they will deepen their practical knowledge.
                            Participants will also receive support materials, including slides, links and references to
                            XAI tools, and examples of user studies.</p>

                        <p>Ronal is a Research Scientist with the Human Centric Security team in CSIRO's Data61 and a
                            member of the CINTEL FSP. Ronal's primary interest lies in artificial intelligence,
                            particularly multi-modal human-agent interactions, AI-assisted decision-making, explainable
                            AI, intention recognition, and multiagent communication planning. Previously, he was a
                            Research Fellow in Human-Agent Collaboration and an Associate Lecturer in the School of
                            Computing and Information Systems at the University of Melbourne. Ronal completed his PhD in
                            2018 from the University of Melbourne and his BSc and MSc degrees in Computer Science from
                            the University of the South Pacific in the Fiji Islands.

                        <p>Tim is a Professor of Artificial Intelligence in the School of Electrical Engineering and
                            Computer Science at The University of Queensland, Meaanjin/Brisbane, Australia. His research
                            draws on machine learning, reinforcement learning, AI planning, interaction design, and
                            cognitive science, to help people to make better decisions. He has done work on areas
                            including explainable AI, human-AI planning, and human-centered decision support. Prior to
                            his appointment at The University of Queensland, Tim was a Professor of Computer Science in
                            the School of Computing and Information Systems at The University of Melbourne, where he was
                            founding co-director of The Centre for AI and Digital Ethics. He is an honorary professor at
                            the University of Melbourne.
