#### Abstract:

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) extend the benefits of deep learning to graph data. In practice, their applications span from common utilities such as recommendation systems and fraud detection, to advanced domains such as drug discovery and physics simulation. Due to the increasing popularity of GNNs, commercial Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) platforms have integrated graph learning development tools for launching GNN services on the cloud, e.g., Amazon SageMaker integrated DGL. Despite the convenience and low cost of model development and deployment, such service is facing critical security challenges. In this talk, I will first overview the architecture of GNNs in MLaaS and elaborate on practical threats against privacy and integrity of GNNs. Then I will present our recent effort in detecting and counteracting training data misuse in GNNs. Along the line, I will also pinpoint open problems and future directions in this area.
