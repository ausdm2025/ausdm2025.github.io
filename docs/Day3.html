                        <h4>Abstract:</h4>
                        <p>One of the most urgent issues facing Australian and other First Nations peoples is the
                            repatriation of their ancestors' bodily remains, many of which are still held in Western
                            scientific institutions. The return of these remains for proper reburial is a critical
                            matter of cultural and ethical importance. However, success in this effort often depends on
                            locating records—scattered across scientific and historical literature from 1790 to
                            1970—that document the theft, donation, sale, or exchange of these remains between
                            institutions. In this talk, I will explore how text-mining techniques can be applied to
                            identify and extract this crucial information from vast textual archives, providing
                            invaluable support for repatriation. The talk will highlight practical challenges,
                            innovative approaches and the potential impact of these technologies in empowering
                            communities to reclaim their cultural heritage.</p>
