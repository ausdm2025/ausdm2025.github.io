                        <h4>Abstract:</h4>
                        <p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) extend the benefits of deep learning to graph data. In practice,
                            their applications span from common utilities such as recommendation systems and fraud
                            detection, to advanced domains such as drug discovery and physics simulation. Due to the
                            increasing popularity of GNNs, commercial Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) platforms
                            have integrated graph learning development tools for launching GNN services on the cloud,
                            e.g., Amazon SageMaker integrated DGL. Despite the convenience and low cost of model
                            development and deployment, such service is facing critical security challenges. In this
                            talk, I will first overview the architecture of GNNs in MLaaS and elaborate on practical
                            threats against privacy and integrity of GNNs. Then I will present our recent effort in
                            detecting and counteracting training data misuse in GNNs. Along the line, I will also
                            pinpoint open problems and future directions in this area.</p>
