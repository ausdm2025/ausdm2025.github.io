                        <h4>Abstract:</h4>
                        <p>Computational and statistical analytic methods alone may not solve the big data problems
                            effectively, and their results could be rejected by users due to the lack of trust and
                            interpretability. Interactive visualisation can explain, verify, and allow users to explore
                            and see computed and original data in interpretable ways informing pattern recognition,
                            insight, and relationship discovery. With so much information at your fingertips, it is a
                            challenge to visualise complex and multidimensional data, highlight important messages, and
                            remove the clutters that may cost audience an extra cognitive load.</p>
                        <p>This tutorial serves as a practical guide that provides theoretical knowledge and
                            visualisation in exploratory and explanatory data analysis. The tutorial includes hands-on
                            activities and practical demonstrations on how computational analytics can connect with
                            visualisation on Tableau and Python platforms. Finally, we will showcase an interactive
                            method to visualise complex charts, and flow charts on maps using the above platforms.</p>
