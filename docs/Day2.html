                        <h4>Abstract:</h4>
                        <p>The need for digital transformation is well acknowledged both locally and globally. While
                            Industry 4.0 has paved significant inroads to support this transformation it is still an
                            emerging area for many organisations (especially Small to Medium Businesses). In this talk,
                            I will introduce key concepts of Industry 4.0 and the emerging Industry 5.0 paradigm that
                            aid Human Centric Digital Transformation. Through a series of real-world digital
                            transformation industry case studies in the areas of manufacturing and smart cities I will
                            highlight key research in the area of Human Centric Digital Transformation. I will conclude
                            the talk by identifying open research opportunities and challenges.</p>
