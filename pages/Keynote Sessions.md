# NAOI – Improving Science by Integrating Strong AI

## Michael Witbrock

#### Abstract:
Science generally, and biology, ecology and economics in particular, has sought to model ever more complex systems ever more precisely and accurately. Processing limitations of human individuals and of human teams limit our ability to do this effectively. We are now seeing signs of genuine intellectual power in AI systems, along with some limitations that make current systems unreliable as partners in scientific teams. However, these limitations are not irreducible, and are far more subject to engineering correction than human cognitive limitations. In this talk, I’ll describe some ways that near-future AI may help us greatly accelerate the work of science, while improving quality and impact, and what is being done to get it to that state.

Michael Witbrock received his BSc(Hons) in Physiological Psychology from Otago University, and his PhD in Computer Science (AI) from Carnegie Mellon University. He previously held positions at Lycos, Cycorp and IBM Research, and currently is a full professor at the University of Auckland, where he leads a research group, the Strong AI Lab, at the intersection of machine learning, reasoning and natural language understanding, with an additional focus on maximising the near-term benefit of AI to Aotearoa/NZ, and more generally achieving the best global social and civilizational impacts of increasingly powerful AI. While maintaining a strong interest in knowledge-capture and natural language understanding, his current research goals involve the development and use of systems that learn to perform careful reasoning and carry out complex tasks. He is the founding director of the NAOInstitute which studies Natural, Artificial and Organisational Intelligence, and how they interact.
