                    <h1>Call for Papers</h1>
                    <p>The <strong>Australasian Data Science and Machine Learning Conference (AusDM)</strong>, formerly
                        known as the Australasian Data Mining Conference, has established itself as the premier
                        Australasian meeting for both practitioners and researchers in the fields of Data Science
                        including but not limited to Data Analytics and Data Mining theory and applications and Machine
                        Learning including but not limited Deep Learning and Generative AI. Despite the evolution of
                        these interdisciplinary fields, AusDM is devoted to the art and science of intelligent learning
                        and analysis of (usually big) data sets for meaningful (and previously unknown) insights that
                        could be actionable. Hence, it enables the sharing and learning of research and progress in the
                        local context and breakthroughs in these interdisciplinary fields.</p>
                    <p>Since AusDM’02, the conference has been providing a forum for disseminating, presenting,
                        showcasing and discussing the latest research and developments in all aspects of Data Science
                        and Machine Learning, including algorithms, software, systems and applications across all
                        industries. Built on this tradition, AusDM’24 will facilitate the cross-disciplinary exchange of
                        ideas, experiences, practices and potential research directions. Speciﬁcally, the conference
                        seeks to showcase: Research Prototypes, Industry Case Studies, Practical Technology, and
                        Research Student Projects.</p>
                    <p>It is aimed to be a meeting place for pushing forward the frontiers of Data Science and Machine
                        Learning in academia and industry. Thus, AusDM’24 will have a variety of engaging activities
                        such as keynote speeches, panel discussions, full paper presentations, tutorials/ workshops,
                        doctoral consortium, social/ networking events, etc.</p>
                    <h1>Topics of Interest</h1>
                    <p>We are calling for papers, both research and applications, and from both academia and industry,

                    <p>Please note that AusDM’24 requires that at least one author for each accepted paper register for
                        the conference and present their work for the paper to be published in the proceeding.</p>
