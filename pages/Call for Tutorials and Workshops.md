# Call for Tutorials and Workshops

We’re pleased to invite you to contribute to **The 21st Australasian Data Science and Machine Learning Conference (AUSDM’23)**, a premier event for both practitioners and researchers in the realm of data mining. This year’s conference is set to take place in Auckland, New Zealand, from the 11th to the 13th of December, 2023. Our theme this year is “Data Science and Machine Learning: Now part of everyone everyday”​.
AUSDM’23 will feature an array of tutorials and workshops, and we are now welcoming proposals for these sessions. These are excellent opportunities to provide both introductory knowledge and in-depth exploration on topics related to data mining from a theoretical and practical perspective. We encourage proposals that will appeal to a wide variety of interests within our community
